The San Francisco per capita income from the years 2005-2019 was collected from the first source. The number of 1 bedroom units listed on craiglist in San Francisco from the same years was collected from the second source. The number of listed units below 1/3 of the median income per capita was used to determine the percentage of affordable vs unaffordable housing for each year. 

# Project details
The San Francisco rental market has become a symbol of growing unaffordability. Over the years, rents have steadily climbed, far outpacing the wage growth. This trend, fueled by factors like limited housing supply and high demand from tech industires, has pushed mnay residents out, particularly low and middle-income earners. While recent months have seen a slight dip in rents, the overall picture remains stark, leaving many struggling to find and maintain stable housing in the city.

This ambient data display visualizes the change in ratio between afforadble (in blue) and unaffordable (in red) housing for a 1 bedroom apartment in San Francisco over the years of 2005-2019 based on the average income per capita at the time and by using the "no more than 1/3 of your income" rule for monthly rent.
